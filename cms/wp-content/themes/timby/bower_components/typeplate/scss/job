Circle Digital is a young web agency operating out of London and Nairobi, Kenya. We are looking for a middle weight web developer to join the team in London.

The perfect developer will have worked in an agency or freelance environment for at least two years. Our work is varied – split between Wordpress custom builds for publishing and marketing purposes and more in depth web application builds for NGOs, startups and larger clients – so your skills should be flexible too (which makes it more fun anyway).

Current clients are Curtis Brown Literary and Talent Agency (largest agency in Europe), Daily Nation (East Africa's largest web property), Macmillan, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, BitPesa (Bitcoin startup featured in NY Times and Bloomberg), and Semana Economica (Peru's most important economics publication) among others.

We work across continents with clients in South America, East Africa and Europe. Travel is part of the job if you want it to be. Our office in Nairobi is on an acre of land with banana and avocado tress. Our office is in the middle of Dalston in an old linen factory with high ceilings and parque flooring.

Some basic tech reqs:
PHP (we still work quite a bit in Wordpress, good to have some CodeIgniter experience)
Back-end JS (node.js in particular)
MySQL
MongoDB
AngularJS (or other frontend framework experience)
Basic server management skills (Apache, Nginx)
Github expert
Experience in agile methods

How to Apply
Would love to meet for tea and/or coffee and talk through what you are looking for and see if we match up. Please also send a resume and a cover letter but please do include some work that you have done on Github or Bitbucket if you can. hello@circle.co.ke
