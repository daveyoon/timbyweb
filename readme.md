## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation

### Configuration
Install grunt on the command line using 'npm install -g grunt-cli'
Install all plugins 'npm install'
Run 'grunt' to watch for sass and js changes
You need to install SASS on the command line. On a mac 'gem install sass' works fine.
If using XAMPP or MAMP you might have to 'sudo grunt' to give it permission to write in various folders. (Bleck, I know).
